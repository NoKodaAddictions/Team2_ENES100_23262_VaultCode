# The Vault, by Team 2: The Excels
### For ENES100-23262 at Northwest High School

This is Project Vault, by Team 2: The Excels for ENES100-23262 at Northwest High School. The vault is a multi-authentication lock system to store possessions and valuables. The system includes passcode and card input to ensure the user can log in through their preferred choice and locks out after a set number of attempts. We aim for the vault to be spacious yet durable and secure. Our overall timeline for this project will span the Montgomery College Fall 2023 semester (ending on December 15th).

### Background
When we received our Elegoo Arduino kit for the first time, we were awestruck by the amount of available parts. We were most interested in the pin pad, display, RFID, and infrared (IR) remote modules, and we conceptualized how to put them together. We immediately thought of a security system of some sort, and after further discussion and initial research, we decided on a vault lock system that included multiple input methods.

### Objective
By creating a vault with multiple authentication inputs and securities, we want to ensure this vault is secure and convenient for the consumer by the end of the Montgomery College Fall 2023 semester
